# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to **Advent of Code 2025** implemented in Python.

## Project Structure

The code is organized by day under `src`:
Each day folder typically contains:

- `main.py` \- solution for the day
- `input.txt` \- personal puzzle input
- `test.txt` \- sample input (if provided by the puzzle)

## Requirements

- Python \>= 3.8

## Running a Solution
From the project root:
```bash
cd src/dayXX
python3 main.py
```

The program will read from input.txt in the current day directory and print the results for part 1 and part 2, for example:
```
Part 1: 4449991244405
Part 2: 9348430857627
```
